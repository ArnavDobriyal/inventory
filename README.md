# Inventory Management System

## Overview:

This Inventory Management System is a web application built using FastAPI, designed to facilitate inventory management tasks for both owners and customers. It allows users to sign up, log in, view their respective dashboards, manage inventory items, track item expiry, and perform replenishment actions. The system distinguishes between owners and customers, providing tailored functionalities to each user type.

## Features:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up with their name, phone number, email, and password.
   - Existing users can log in using their credentials.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Upon login, users are directed to their respective dashboards based on their user type (admin or customer).
   - The dashboard provides an overview of relevant information and actions available to the user.

3. **Inventory Management:**
   - Owners can view their inventory, including details like total items, small items, large items, and items stored in the fridge.
   - Owners can add new items to their inventory, specifying details such as name, expiry date, size, quantity, perishable status, and type.
   - Customers can view the items available to them.
   - Customers can delete items from their inventory.

4. **Item Expiry Tracking:**
   - Both owners and customers can view expired items.
   - Expiry details are displayed, enabling users to take necessary actions such as replenishment or removal.

5. **Replenishment:**
   - Owners can view items that need replenishment and take appropriate actions.
   - Customers can also view items that need replenishment.

6. **Customer Management:**
   - Owners can view details of all customers, facilitating customer management tasks.
   - Owners can delete customer accounts.


## Key Concepts and Customization:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement more robust authentication methods such as OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth2.
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC) or permission management features for controlling user access.

2. **Database Management:**
   - Customize the database schema and table structures according to your specific requirements.
   - Explore options for database migration tools or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Integrate a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
   - Implement responsive design principles for compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Implement input validation, output encoding, CSRF protection, and HTTPS encryption.
   - Regularly audit the codebase for security vulnerabilities and apply patches or updates.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Monitor and optimize critical components such as database queries, API endpoints, and frontend rendering.
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency and improve response times.
